# Wonderbill

## start instructions

`git clone https://github.com/RichMatthews/wonder-bill`
`cd wonder-bill/web-app`
`yarn && yarn start`

You will also need to start the server

`cd wonder-bill/api`
`yarn && yarn start`

## testing

`yarn test`

I would normally write more tests but as this was a tech challenge I just kept it to a few to demonstrate I know how to test without going over board. I would normally write e2e tests too to cover normal user journeys

## other notes

I have never used Redux-toolkit before so spent some time reading the docs and understanding the API. I really like it and enjoyed using it in this challenge! But apologies if the standards aren't quite up to scratch. I am more use to a traditional redux approach with higher order components using connect and so forth. However, I much prefer this way now I've spent some time using it.

any questions, let me know!
